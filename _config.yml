  Hello, my name is Luo YiKai, an undergraduate candidate in Digital Media Technology at Hangzhou Dianzi University.
  I am researching in Image and Video Systems Lab., under the supervision of Professor Yong Man Ro.
  My major research area is multi-modal representation learning and human interactive learning. 
  I am more focusing on integrating audio, video, and text modalities in human dialogue system, especially lipreading, lip-to-speech synthesis, and audio-visual speech recognition. 
  I am also interested in machine translation, speech enhancement, and speech separation using multi-modal representations.
